# Tank Game

This is my experiment working with NodeJS, Canvas and HTML5.  It is driven by a server engine (app.js) and client engine (clientengine.js), and it uses game loop intervals.

-----------------------------

### Important Files

[App.js](app.js) - The server side engine.

[ClientEngine.js](/public/js/clientengine.js) - The client side engine.  This controls drawing to the canvas, and it handles keyboard events.

[Globals.js](/public/js/globals.js) - global variables on the client side.  Specifically, the canvas object, the 2D context.
